For this project we were told to make a word guess game.  We could theme it and style it in any way that we liked. I chose to make a Harry Potter themed hangman game.  You enter letters and try and guess the different objects from the Harry Potter books and movies.  

I used HTML to write the basic structure of the game and used CSS to style it with a Hogwarts photo and some texts from google fonts that reminded me of the font-style from the Harry Potter movies and posters.  I really enjoyed styling the game and had a lot of fun making it look as Harry Potter-esque as I could.  Finally, I used javascript for the functionality of the game.  

It was my first deep dive into javascript, and probably the most challenging project for me to date.  I had to look up a lot of tutorials and youtube videos and ask a lot of questions to get my game working.  The game functionality was hugely challenging as someone who was brand new to coding.  I had been coding less than a month when we got this assignment but it felt great to figure it out.
