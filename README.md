This is a Harry Potter themed hangman style game.  You enter letters and try and guess the different objects from the Harry Potter books and movies.  

I used HTML to write the basic structure of the game and used CSS to style it with a Hogwarts photo and some texts from google fonts that reminded me of the font-style from the Harry Potter movies and posters.  I really enjoyed styling the game and had a lot of fun making it look as Harry Potter-esque as I could.  Finally, I used javascript for the functionality of the game.  It was my first deep dive into javascript, and probably the most challenging project for me to date.
