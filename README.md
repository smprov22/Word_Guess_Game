# Word_Guess_Game

This is a Harry Potter themed hangman style game.  You enter letters and try and guess the different objects from the Harry Potter books and movies.  

I used HTML to write the basic structure of the game and styled it with a Hogwarts photo and some texts from google fonts that reminded me of the font-style from the Harry Potter movies and posters.  I really enjoyed styling the game and had a lot of fun making it look as Harry Potter-esque as I could.  Finally, I used javascript to make the game playable.  This was very challenging as my grasp of javascript isn't where I want it to be yet, but I think it came together nicely.
